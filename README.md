### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I learned a little bit more about how it works to work on a project. I understood the importance of a responsive page for screen types other than that of a computer, and I improved my use of HTML and CSS. I plan to continue my project development journey to improve on the front-end.

### Continued development

I plan to improve my sense of the front end with future projects so that my next projects will be cleaner, more enjoyable, and more responsive. Making them better is my goal with these challenges.
